 * Hook to access cluster-scoped property values exposed to plugins. Valid

 * (MainLayoutProvider → DetailDrawerProvider). Calling this from a component
 * rendered outside that subtree (e.g. Settings, Marketplace, or any future
 * app-wide screen) will throw, because the underlying host state
 * (DetailDrawerContext) has no provider there. A future appWideAPI will
 * cover capabilities that don't have this constraint.
 *
 * Example:
 *   const { activeContext, activeNamespaces, activeResource, availableNamespaces, resourceLinks, unifiedTray } = clusterWideAPI.useExposeProperties();
 *   resourceLinks.pod(namespace, podName);  // Opens pod detail drawer
 *   unifiedTray.openTab("my-plugin-family", { pluginId: "my-plugin", label: "...", dedupeKey: "..." });
 *
 * This signature is duplicated from the host's real implementation at
 * frontend/src/expose/hooks/useExposeProperties.ts (which this package can't
 * import directly — see main.tsx's vendor injection). If that hook's return
 * type changes, update this signature to match.
