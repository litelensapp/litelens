description: root go.work was removed for good (no go.work file), but a bare `replace` directive for packages/core in go.mod is now a permanent, intentional part of the architecture — not a shim to remove

CURRENT STATE (2026-08-21, branch `chore/remove-go-work-shim`): root `go.mod` has `replace github.com/litelensapp/litelens/packages/core => ./packages/core`, permanently — this is intentional, not a temporary shim to remove before merge. No root `go.work`/`go.work.sum` file exists or is planned; the bare `replace` line is sufficient and simpler.

**Why this is correct, not a regression:** `packages/core` is the host's own extension surface — same role as `@litelens/core` on the frontend, which the frontend resolves via pnpm `workspace:*` (always local source, no version pin). Host and `packages/core` ship from the same commit, so the version pin in `require github.com/litelensapp/litelens/packages/core vX.Y.Z` is decorative for the host build; `replace` makes the host always build against local `packages/core` source, matching the frontend pattern. Confirmed via `go build ./...`, `go vet ./internal/...`, `go test -race ./internal/...` — all pass with the replace directive present.

**What still needs real tags:** external plugin repos (e.g. `litelens-plugins`) are the actual consumers of pinned `packages/core/vX.Y.Z` releases — they don't get the `replace` directive, so tags must still be cut whenever plugin-facing surface (`pb`, `dto`, `kube.LoadingRules`) changes, to keep plugins buildable against a real published version. The `require` line's version number in the host's `go.mod` should still be bumped opportunistically to stay close to the latest tag (keeps `go.sum`/`go mod tidy` sane and avoids the pin drifting to something ancient), but it no longer gates host builds the way it did right after the original go.work removal.

Original history: root `go.work` was deleted (2026-08-21 earlier same day) once `packages/core/v1.7.0` was tagged, moving `internal/` to a normal pinned dependency — this was itself the removal of an interim mechanism from Phase 4 of [[plugin-architecture-inversion]] (before any tag existed, `go.work` substituted the on-disk directory so `go build ./internal/...` could resolve `packages/core` at all). The bare `replace` directive reintroduced here is a distinct, smaller mechanism (no `go.work` file) chosen deliberately for the host↔core pairing, not a reversion to the old go.work setup.
