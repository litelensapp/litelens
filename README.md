Litelens is a lightweight, native desktop dashboard for managing Kubernetes
clusters. It's built with [Wails](https://wails.io) (Go backend + React
webview, no Electron), so it stays small and fast while giving you a clean,
modern watch-based UI over your cluster.

## Installation

For step-by-step installation instructions, see https://litelensapp.github.io/#installation

## Uninstallation

See [docs/uninstallation.md](docs/uninstallation-v2.md).

## Architecture

Litelens has no HTTP/REST layer between its frontend and backend. Wails
auto-generates TypeScript bindings for every exported Go method, so the React
frontend calls Go directly as if it were a local async function; Go, in turn,
watches the Kubernetes API via informers and pushes live updates back to the
frontend as Wails events, rather than the frontend polling for changes.

- **Request/response**: the frontend calls a bound Go method (e.g.
  `GetPods(namespace)`) through the Wails-generated bindings; Go runs it and
  returns the result over the same call, same as awaiting a local function.
- **Push updates**: Go's informers watch the cluster in the background and
  emit Wails events (e.g. `pods:update`) whenever cluster state changes; the
  frontend's per-resource event hooks subscribe to these events and merge the
  pushed payload into the existing TanStack Query cache, so views stay live
  without re-polling.
